# puck_temp_mon originally "puck_things"
# The following obtained from http://forum.espruino.com/conversations/298104/#comment13400838
The intended use of this app was to monitor the temperature of an air conditioned office using a puck.js device

The Red LED flashes when the temperature gets 25ยบ. The Blue LED flashes when it's 22ยบ or lower.
If you click the Puck (button) the temperature monitoring will switch Off/On. If it blinks green on clicking - you turned the monitoring On.
To save some battery the temperature monitoring will turn Off automatically according to the schedule (time of the day and day of the week).
